arch/aarch64/gic.cc - same as above

DIRECT calls to preempt_disable()
./core/per-cpu-counter.cc:14 - MAYBE this one is "do nothing" as the code between preempt_disable() and preempt_disable() does not seem to

-- void thread::wake()
./core/sched.cc:1223:    WITH_LOCK(rcu_read_lock) {

-- void thread_handle::wake()
./core/sched.cc:1436:    WITH_LOCK(rcu_read_lock) {

preempt_lock - all addressed
