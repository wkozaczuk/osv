Possibly revisit the order of "IFs" in trace.cc in respect of possible stack pre-fault

DIRECT calls to preempt_disable()
./core/per-cpu-counter.cc:14 - MAYBE this one is "do nothing" as the code between preempt_disable()
                               and preempt_disable() does not seem to using any stack
./core/spinlock.cc

rcu_read_lock - all addressed

preempt_lock - all addressed

====================================
- add core/mmu.cc double pre-fault logic (mmap(), etc)
- enable lazy_stack with conf
- add unit tests for lazy stack
- add tracepoint for lazy stack page fault
- add Nadav's patch
