  -d tst-dlfcn.so \ - who knows why
  -d tst-futimesat.so \ - see utimen
  -d tst-ifaddrs.so \ - see below
  -d tst-kill.so \ - crashes
  -d tst-net_if_test.so \ - this and ifaddr relies on netlink which does not work correcty with glibc
  -d tst-select-timeout.so \
  -d tst-symlink-rofs.so \ - possibly stat structure diff
  -d tst-symlink.so \ - same as above
  -d tst-ttyname.so \ - fails on Linux - maybe OSv specific
  -d tst-utimensat.so \ - this and possibly tst-futimesat.so needs to treat dirfd differently in syscall
  \
  -d tst-eventfd.so - fails occasionally
